- 👋 Hi, I’m @StephenFlanagansss
- 👀 I’m interested in lots of things both related to technology and people. As a support technician I'm experienced in PowerShell and SQL. 
-     Outside of this I'm interested in Robotics (Lego MindStorms) and electronics (Rasberry Pi)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, C# and how to use Linux
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, my coding experience is growing, but I'm pretty good at documentation.
- 📫 How to reach me Mastadon: @SFlanagan@mastodon.me.uk
